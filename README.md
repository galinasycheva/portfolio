| Predicting the Churn rate for Fitness Centers | KMeans, Machine Learning, dendrogram, RandomForestClassifier,LogisticRegression |Machine learning was used in this project. The probability of churn (for the next month) for each client was predicted; typical user profiles were formed: the most prominent groups were identified, their main properties were characterized; the main features that most strongly influence churn were analyzed.|[gym-project](https://github.com/galinasycheva/portfolio/tree/main/gym_project)|
|Testing hypotheses to increase revenue in an online store -evaluate the results of an A/B test|A/B test, statistical test, framework, RICE, ICE, Matplotlib,SciPy|Prioritization of hypotheses was carried out using the ICE and RICE frameworks. Then I analyzed the A/B test results, plotted graphs of cumulative revenue, average check, and conversion by group, and then calculated the statistical significance of differences in conversions and average checks using raw and cleaned data.|[shop_abtest](https://github.com/galinasycheva/portfolio/tree/main/shop_abtest)|

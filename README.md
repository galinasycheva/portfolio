| Project |Skills|Description|Link|
| --- | --- |--- |--- |
| Predicting the Churn rate for Fitness Centers | KMeans, Machine Learning, dendrogram, RandomForestClassifier,LogisticRegression |Machine learning was used in this project. The probability of churn (for the next month) for each client was predicted; typical user profiles were formed: the most prominent groups were identified, their main properties were characterized; the main features that most strongly influence churn were analyzed.|[gym-project](https://github.com/galinasycheva/portfolio/tree/main/gym_project)|
|Testing hypotheses to increase revenue in an online store - evaluate the results of an A/B test|A/B test, statistical test, framework, RICE, ICE, Matplotlib,SciPy|Prioritization of hypotheses was carried out using the ICE and RICE frameworks. Then I analyzed the A/B test results, plotted graphs of cumulative revenue, average check, and conversion by group, and then calculated the statistical significance of differences in conversions and average checks using raw and cleaned data.|[shop_abtest](https://github.com/galinasycheva/portfolio/tree/main/shop_abtest)|
|Mobile apps: behavioral cohorts analysis|PYthon, Pandas,matplotlib, scipy|A cohort analysis of the behavior of users of an app for selling things was conducted. Hypotheses were tested about which source of conversion of users to the target action is better| [apps-project](https://github.com/galinasycheva/portfolio/tree/main/apps_project)|
|Research of the job market for data analysts and system analysts|PYthon, Pandas,matplotlib|This project is dedicated to the research of the current job market offered for data analysts/system analysts.|[hh-analytics](https://github.com/galinasycheva/portfolio/blob/main/hh_analytics/README.md)|

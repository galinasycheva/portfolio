# A/B testing for an online store

In this project I will show part of the work that I did together with the marketing department of an online flower shop. My tasks included: analyzing the proposed hypotheses using the ICE and RISE methods, as well as analyzing the results of A/B testing for one of the hypotheses.

## Conclusion
- with ICE framework, the leaders are hypotheses eight, zero and seven. With 'RICE' framework, the top three are hypotheses 7, 2 and 0. Hypothesis 2 is higher in the 'RICE framework because it has a high Reach indicator (as well as 7 and 0), but the eighth hypothesis flew out of the top three - it has a very low indicator.
- before analyzing the A/B test results, the data was prepared - the data type of the 'date' columns was corrected, a check for duplicates and missing values was performed.
- the analysis showed that there are statistically significant differences in the average number of orders per visitor between the groups (both on raw and cleaned data). On cleaned data, the relative increase in the average number of orders of group B to group A is 17.3%.
- the analysis showed that it is impossible to reject the hypothesis that there is a statistical difference in the average check per visitor between the groups (both on raw and on cleaned data)

The test results are indicative, the average number of orders increased in the absence of significant changes in the average check -> revenue increased, as people began to buy more often, the testing can be considered successful, stopped and moved on to other hypotheses.
